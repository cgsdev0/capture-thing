# capture-thing

this is some scuffed code yoinked from [here](https://github.com/microsoft/Windows.UI.Composition-Win32-Samples/tree/master/cpp/ScreenCaptureforHWND) that auto captures any window on a particular monitor and makes it available via [spout](https://spout.zeal.co/).

you don't want to use this garbage go away it's mostly just for me

you can steal from it though if you want i guess i don't care

the original code is MIT license, and so is this
